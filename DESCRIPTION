Description: Performs discrete, real, and gentle logistic regression model under 
             both initial model and model with L2 norm regularization. The package provides solving 
             algorithm includes three types of algorithms, namely gradient descent method, 
             accelerated gradient descent method and Newton method with functions can simply output
             confusion matrix, evaluation indicators and visualize descent process.
